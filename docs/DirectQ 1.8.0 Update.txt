DIRECTQ 1.8.0 FULL RELEASE
==========================

This release follows the 1.8.0 beta release, and addresses technical omissions and errors.  This is the final full release of DirectQ 1.8.0
and addresses all bugs that were reported (and some that weren't), as well as introducing some new last-minute features.

- Fixed bug where on some gfx cards alias models with fullbright colours would render all grey owing to a bad texture blend mode.
- Added cl_fullpitch cvar (default 0) to extend look up/down viewangles to full 90/-90 range.
- Values of r_drawviewmodel between 0 and 1 can now give permanent gun alpha.
- Fixed Quark ETP weirdness by re-enabling D3DCREATE_FPU_PRESERVE.
- Added ability for 2D gfx to load from /gfx as well as from /textures/gfx.
- Fixed incorrect protocol version in release builds.


DIRECTQ 1.8.0 UPDATES
=====================

* Added Host_WriteConfiguration command to write out current config.cfg
* Significantly cleaned out in-memory alias model format, faster loading, less RAM usage, nicer code.
* Fixed crash bug if the gun is the only alias model in the scene when DirectQ starts up (ouch!)
* Removed bug where brushmodels were being drawn twice (goes back to 1.6 I think).
* Rationalised header file usage a little and got rid of a lot of ugly casts.
* Moved entire project back to September 2004 D3D9 SDK (better compatibility with more systems).
* Added cl_maxparticles cvar to control the max number of particles that can be allocated (default 65536).
* Added sv_progs support.
* Moved a lot of progs handling to a class in prep for CSQC support.
* Increased particle size to more accurately match GLQuake.
* A LOT of clean-up and rationalization on 2D rendering.
* Further restructuring of alias models; massive speed increase from switch to triangle lists.
* Added connect host:port command format (uses currently set port if none specified).
* Restored gl_triplebuffer cvar and made it do what it actually should (use triple buffered rendering).
* Fixed rare crash bug when a viewmodel is switched and the previous had a frame num higher than the number of frames in the new.
* Fixed bug where a surf with extents > 4000ish would get invalid lightmap coords.
* Restored infinite projection matrix, dynamic clip dist is now just used for positioning skyboxes.
* Removed r_normqrain as it no longer has a detrimental effect.
* Removed try/catch gamma preservation hack as it didn't work.
* Precalculated interpolated alias model shading dot products to less than degree accuracy.
* Added support for recording demos at any time.
* Completely reworked brushmodel render and in-memory formats for better efficiency, especially with large open complex scenes.
* Added r_trilistsize to control render batch sizing, set to -1 to autotune (default), 1 for default Quake behaviour, anything else to override.
* Added death "fade to black" effect, nice and subtle (disabled in multiplayer).
* Changed lightmaps to tall but narrow for better upload and cache efficiency.
* Fixed some memory leaks in the shader system.
* Fixed console scale not updating properly after a mode switch.
* Cleaned out more disgusting legacy gl_vidnt.c globals storing multiple copies of the same data but which go out of sync too easily.
* Fixed occasional crash when releasing a texture on shutdown.
* No, *really* fixed it.
* Increased max temp entities to 21,845.
- Anti-z-fighting hack has been fixed.
- Extra bmodels in automap fixed.
- Max beams gone up to 29,127.
- Fixed QC attempts to set cvars that don't exist crashing the engine.
- Fixed issue with drivers that don't obey the stride parameter to DrawPrimitiveUP.
- Switched main render to VBOs (aside from particles which were hugely inefficient).
- Fixed save games showing incorrect kill counts in save/load menu.
- Fixed incorrect bmodel x rotation (gah!)
- Made r_speeds counts more consistent with GLQuake.
- Added occlusion queries on all alias models.
- Removed use of r_lightmap cvar.
- Restored VBO use for r_hlsl 0 sky warp.
- Added compatibility warning to gamedir menu when Quoth is enabled.
- Fixed long-standing DirectQ "gamma creep" bug, and greatly simplified gamma handling.
