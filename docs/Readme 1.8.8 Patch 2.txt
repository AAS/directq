DirectQ 1.8.8 Patch Release 2
-----------------------------

This release focusses on code quality and bug fixes rather than on adding any radical new features; if the
previous release of DirectQ worked fine for you there is probably no need to download this one.

It contains the beginnings of an "enhanced" particles system, but that's quite unfinished.  You can turn it
on and use it if you wish, but be aware that what you're seeing is NOT a finished or stable work.

Happy shambler hunting.
