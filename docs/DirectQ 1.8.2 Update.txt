DIRECTQ 1.8.2 UPDATE
====================

I've been somewhat remiss in keeping my change log up to date for this so what you see below is a fraction of the full thing.
Visit http://mhquake.blogspot.com for the whole story of what's happened over the past two months since 1.8.1

Credit is due to everyone who received and tested a build of this for me; there were quite a few of you and I don't want to
single out anyone here so I'll just say that you know who you are and the help was appreciated.  This build would have been a
lesser thing without you.

- Optimized water warp shader (possibly quite significantly, hardware dependent).
- Fixed "Current Stats" display for new save games.
- Fine-tuned occlusion queries for better correctness.
- Added Shader Model 3 profile support on appropriate hardware (automatic).
- Resolved several issues with level names (server messages) > 128 chars.
- Added Maps and Demos submenus to Options menu.
- Reworked external texture loader for better flexibility and faster loading (especially where the external texture doesn't exist).
- Fixed view weirdness with cl_bobcycle 0.
- Fixed Sys_Error on MD5 operations in some versions of Windows.
- Fixed cursor in console is broken.
- Fixed maps that do not have a server message prematurely terminating the map list in the multiplayer menus.
- Added elapsed time to multiplayer scoreboard.
- Lots of other stuff.
