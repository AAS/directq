DirectQ HUD Scripts
===================

HUD Scripts are just cfg files containing cvar settings that define the layout of the HUD elements.  Because there are so many of them they are not
saved into config.cfg; the command "savehud" is provided instead:

	savehud myhud

Will create "myhud.cfg" in your root folder.  You can then edit it, exec it, add it to your autoexec or whatever you want.  Note - the "defaulthud" cvar can contain a HUD script that is automatically loaded when you run Quake.

This is necessary because there are so many different HUD items (and different *types* of HUD items) in Quake, all with goofy non-standard sizes and positioning.

The default HUD layout provided with the engine replicates the classic Quake 1 status bar, so never fear trad fans!

The "savehud" command will not let you save a HUD script with the names "quake.rc", "default.cfg", "config.cfg" or "autoexec.cfg", in case you were wondering (caught you!)

With 5 exceptions, the cvars all follow a consistent naming convention; once you know the naming convention you should be able to figure out what any of the cvars do.  I'll deal with the exceptions first:

defaulthud
----------
Contains the name of the script file that is automatically loaded when you start Quake.

hud_overlay
----------
Specifies whether (0) or not (1) to reserve an area at the bottom of the screen for drawing the HUD in.  0 is the default, and looks like classic Quake.  You should note that the area covered by the main 3D refresh is slightly different with a value of 1.

hud_drawsbar
------------
Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to draw the status bar background picture.  1 is the default, and looks just like classic Quake.

hud_drawibar
------------
Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to draw the inventory bar background picture.  1 is the default, and looks just like classic Quake.

hud_sbaralpha
-------------
Sets an alpha value on the HUD background pictures; only effective if hud_drawsbar and/or hud_drawibar are also set.  Values range from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (default, fully opaque).

Other HUD cvars
---------------
The naming convention used for the other cvars gives 3 elements to each cvar name.  Each element is separated by underscores.

hud: all HUD cvars begin with this.
item name: the name of the item.
positioning: the positioning of the item.

Knowing this, you can figure out what a lot of the cvars do: "hud_sigils_x" is obviously x positioning for sigils.

Some of the positionings may look a little unintuitive.  The full list is:

Basic Positioning
-----------------
All HUD elements have these cvars.

_x:	X positioning.
_y:	Y positioning.
_cx:	1 to center on X axis, 0 for free positioning.
_cy:	1 to center on Y axis, 0 for free positioning.

_x and _y may be positive or negative.  If the corresponding _c cvar is 1, the value is an offset from the center point.  If _c is 0, the value is an offset from the left or top (if positive) or the right or bottom (if negative).

Inventory Positioning
---------------------
Only inventory items (sigils, keys, pickups, weapons, ammo counts, etc) have these cvars.  They can be positive or negative.

_h:	horizontal multiplier: multiply the picture width by this and add to the current x position to get the x position of the next item.
_v:	vertical multiplier: multiply the picture height by this and add to the current y position to get the y position of the next item.
_hs:	horizontal spacing: adds to the result of the horizontal multiplier.
_vs:	vertical spacing: adds to the result of the vertical multiplier.

Armour and Ammo Exceptions
--------------------------
The main armour and ammo icons have an additional cvar each:

_no0:	don't draw the value on-screen if it (the stat value) is 0.  0 is the default, and looks just like classic Quake.

Sample HUD Scripts
------------------
Two sample HUD scripts are provided:

"classichud.cfg": replicates the classic Quake HUD.


Exceptions to classic HUD layout
--------------------------------
Some items are not the same as the classic layout.  These include the scoreboards and the deathmatch overlay.
