DirectQ 1.8.666b
----------------

- reverted to standard input code for singleplayer games.
- fixed a long-standing bug where looking up could be screwy if lookstrafe was on.
- changed wizard and lightning dynamic light colours slightly (GB is right).
- added HLSL fog support (FitzQuake standard).
- increased max allowed skybox size to 1024
- fixed bug where an animation frame in a texture may have the same data as a different texture, causing wackiness.
- removed switchable refresh rates - it's back to your monitor's rate now; this was buggy
- cleaned up some timer code.
- fixed large temporary hang when loading a game.

Performance in this one is down a bit I'm afraid; maintaining certain legacy code paths is starting to have an
impact on my ability to tune the renderer more effectively.  I've since written code without those paths that
goes about 1.5 times faster, and handles heavy scenes more efficiently (up to 4 or 5 times faster).

The next one will see the removal of those legacy code paths.  That means that the hardware requirements will go
up a little; you're going to need an Intel 915, Geforce FX, or Radeon 9500 or better.
