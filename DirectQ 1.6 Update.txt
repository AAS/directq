* Ported trace system from light.exe source code.
* Fixed rotating va buffers disappeared somewhere around 1.2
* Added proper bilinear resampling for texture upsizing.
* Made Heap_TempAlloc more robust against recursive calls.
* Worked around occasional weird crash in Draw_CachePic.
* Removed dedicated server functionality.
* Fixed memory leak in S_LocalSound.
* Fixed shader loading from resources (badly broken).
* Moved project to Visual C++ 2008 Express.
* Added centerprint logging (scr_centerlog - need to change this to a standard cvar name - default on).
* Cleared out gl_triplebuffer and vid.numpages.
* Adding fading to centerprints and console notifications.
* Fixed bug where brush and sprite static ents were not rendered unless a regular brush or sprite ent was also rendered.
* Tightened up on textbox input for content names and locations menu.
* Added customisation of base save and screenshot names.

* Fixed "dying throes" interpolation bug.
* Added Maps menu.
* Restored offset centerprinting from "lost version" somewhere around 1.2 or 1.3 (...long story...)
* Removed limit on number of menu cachepics.
* Removed limit on number of alias verts (fixed vert loader so it only allocs the number of verts needed too).
* Fixed crash bug with game changing followed by map load; made progs loader significantly more robust in the process.

* Added r_skybackscroll and r_skyfrontscroll cvars to control sky scroll speed.
* Split out warp surfaces to a new options submenu and added sky warp control options.
