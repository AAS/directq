DIRECTQ 1.8.3b UPDATE
---------------------

This should probably be numbered 1.8.4 given the changes, but I've talked so much about other things planned for 1.8.4 that
doing so would only lead to confusion.  A lot of these have been backported from my 1.8.4 work as they were quick and easy
to include, and it's nice to do a release that's more than just a few bugfixes.

- Fixed bug where the Zone may occasionally be created with restricted size.
- Fixed ommission of efrag clearing in case the map hasn't been reloaded.
- Bumped maximum number of beams to unlimited.
- Bumped maximum number of temp entities to unlimited.
- Fixed long-standing bug where the mouse could occasionally go outside the window in windowed modes.
- Fixed bug in 2 TMU path where depth writing was incorrectly disabled after second pass.
- Removed non-power-of-2 texture support owing to weird texture scaling issues.
- Removed texture compression from 2D view textures owing to visual degradation.
- Fixed crash when view goes through wall with chase_active 1.
- Fixed "Gimp Suit" effect on player skins.
- Bumped max alias tris and verts to unlimited.
- Fixed player model going to full opacity when extremely close in chase_active 1 mode.
- Implemented PF_TraceToss for Nehahra.
