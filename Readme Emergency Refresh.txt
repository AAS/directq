Release 1.1 Emergency Refresh
=============================

This release was made essential by issues with hardware T&L on some NVidia (only?) drivers.

To at least get things working, I've removed hardware T&L from the startup sequence.

Only the changed code is included; the rest of it is identical to the previous release (which you can freely download with the previous release).
