DIRECTQ 1.8.666 UPDATE
----------------------
(An almost-complete list)

Graphics
- Added r_ambient cvar; set to above 0 to boost the lighting; default 0, disabled in multiplayer.
- Fixed gamma ramping for external textures (consistency).
- Switched skybox render to use a cubemap (performance, simplicity, etc).
- Optimized all vertex shaders by removing a matrix multiplication op.
- Rewrote vertex submission paths.
- Fixed anisotropic filtering and texture filtering in general.
- Heavily tweaked occlusion queries.
- Reworked underwater warp for better performance and quality.
- Added "gl_consolefont" cvar for external charsets (default 0, "charset-1" etc, put them wherever you want).

Multiplayer
- Added rcon.
- Increased "say" and "tell" buffers to 2048 (should be enough for anyone; play nice and no console spamming please).
- Absolute max clients on a DirectQ server is always 16 without needing command-line options.

Net Code
- Ported ProQuake net_dgrm for more robust NAT fix.
- Switched qsockets to dynamically allocated for memory saving and maxplayers flexibility.

Physics
- Corrected bmodel rotation code (ta Baker!)
- Made FPS-independent gravity actually work right (try it with sv_gameplayfix etc 1 and cl_maxfps 10 and see!).

Sound
- Restructured sound mixer for future move to multithreaded.
- Bumped MAX_CHANNELS to 65536 and MAX_DYNAMIC_CHANNELS to 32768.
- Split out sounds that were previously grouped for better ambience and immersion.

UI
- Added crosshairsize alias for scr_crosshairscale.
- Changed default text filtering mode to nearest-neighbour.
- Added texture filter modes to video options menu.
- Restored old status bar update/redraw policy.
- Reworked maps menu.

Unclassified
- Fixed usage of CW_DEFAULT to CW_USEDEFAULT in window creation.
- Reworked and cleaned up timer code.
