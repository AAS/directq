DIRECTQ 1.6.3 UPDATES
=====================

* Fixed wrong version number in Window title.
* Amalgamated readme docs for previous versions.
* Partially implemented fixed path on world and alias models.
* Removed d3d_Device->SetTransform calls (I feel silly for having left them in so long...)
* Added improved state management.
* Removed TimeRefresh command.
* Improved effect pass switching; should no longer switch to a pass if nothing is drawn in that pass.
* Improved BeginScene/EndScene calls to conform with specification and documentation.
* Removed silly translucency check.
* Modified vis loading so that decompression is done at load time.
* Restored anti-wallhack code and added cvar to toggle it (sv_antiwallhack, default 1).
* Fixed bug where D3D lighting was not being disabled.
* Enforced correct default states in the state manager and in the renderer.
* Added enhanced smoke trail particles (r_newparticles 1, default 0).
* Removed framerate dependency from particle system (and anything else using r_frametime for updates).
* Removed framerate dependency from dynamic light system.
* Fixed bug where water surfs, particles and sprites were potentially rendered with an invalid depth bias.
* Added sv_pvsfat cvar to control how fat the fatpvs is; default 8, set to higher values to fix disappearing models in some maps.
* Fixed bug where an entity that touches MAX_ENT_LEAFS, none of which are in the PVS, but the entity should be visible, is not transmitted.
* Added improved entity leaf touch detection as a consequence of the above (functionally identical to old way).
* Removed restriction on number of leafs an entity may be in.
* Adjusted brushmodel loader so that leafs and nodes are in contiguous memory.
* Optimised surface index loading to make map loading substantially faster.
* Substantially optimised other areas of map loading; maps should now load about 10x faster than 1.6.2
* Optimized memory allocations in a more general manner for faster map load times.
* Reworked Cvar_Set (cvar_t *, float) and Cvar_Set (char *, float) to prevent value round-tripping through a char *.
* Added gl_clearcolor command (and _gl_clearcolor cvar, not intended to be used directly) to control background clear colour; default 0 (black).
* Added r_lightscale cvar to help rebalance really bright or really dark maps (default 1).
* Fixed hard crash when you try to run a mod that uses rogue/hipnotic/quoth content without having r/h/q in your gamedirs.
* Added support for DXT1, DXT3 and DXT5 texture compression.
* Moved hud_overlay, hud_sbaralpha, hud_drawsbar and hud_drawibar to CVAR_ARCHIVE for performance boost.
* Changed sv_antiwallhack default to 0.
* Allowed TAB key in demos to display current scores (this is hard-bound, even if you have TAB bound to something else).
* Restored automap code (toggleautomap command, bind to "m" or something) - not very robust or performant right now.
* Fixed solid and sky leafs give waterwarp effect (old GLQuake bug).
* Removed index buffer render (gives BSOD when loading marcher when enabled).
* Fixed crash bug where a surf with an invalid texture (NULL) may get it's lightmap updated (new lightmap sorting makes this invalid too).
* Removed sRGB support - needs to be repeatedly switched off/on again for alpha blending, which seriously hurts perf :(.
* Fixed crash in demos menu where you enter the menu but have no demos; just goes direct to record mode and hides mode selection option.
* Made menu spincontrols more robust vs empty lists (but any custom draws will still need custom handling).
* Trapped a no maps installed condition and made it a Sys_Error (note: maps menu uses the filesystem as well as PAKs so this is safe).
* Added front plane frustum cull test (can cut down on wpoly (and occasionally) epoly count quite a bit), faster as a general case.
* Added improved frustum culling setup and tests via JohnFitz and LordHavoc.
* Added QuakeC "debugger", set qc_debug cvar, 0: none, 1: log to console, 2: log to file "qcdebuglog.txt", 3: log to both console and file.
* Bumped max demos in loop to 64.
* Removed centerprint logging and fading (hopefully temp) - interferes with mods that use centerprints for stats and/or menus in-game.
* Worked around console spamming from centerprint logging; restored it.
