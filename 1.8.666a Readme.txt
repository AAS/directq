This release fixes a bug with the user-selectable depth buffer format, by removing the ability for the user to select the
depth buffer format!  With hindsight this "feature" was probably not necessary, and in any event it didn't work right.

Special thanks to ORL on the quakeone.com forums for reporting this one and for working with me to identify the cause and
the solution.
