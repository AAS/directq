DirectQ 1.8.666
Release Candidate 2
==============

This is Release Candidate 2 of DirectQ 1.8.666; I am holding off on doing a full "stable" release as a LOT of code has
changed behind the scenes since 1.8.4, and there may be quite a few juicy bugs yet to come out.

This release is intended for anyone who is willing to be at the bleeding edge of technology, happy to take the risk that
the engine might crash, and agreeable to report such crashes to me (with enough info to enable me to reproduce them) at
http://mhquake.blogspot.com

Everyone else should just use 1.8.4 and wait a while longer for the "stable" build.

Thanks to Baker and =Peg= for beta-testing this, and everyone else who has made suggestions or provided feedback.

(Technical note: this release is a debug build, meaning that if it crashes, and if you have debugging tools on your
computer, you may be able to provide me with more information relating to the crash.)

Bugs/etc fixed since RC1:

    * Mouse no longer locks when alt-tabbing back to a fullscreen mode.
    * Crashes will now give more descriptive info, including the file name and line number on which the crash event occurred (for those of you who've seen the sys_win.cpp, line 812 crash: that was my error handler!)
    * The Intel 945 "everything is black" bug has now been fixed; this was due to some rogue state changes not being reset properly when switching between HLSL on or off on a software T&L device.
    * Mouse input sending has been reverted to the old way in single-player games.
    * Changing the value of d3dx_version now causes a vid_restart to automatically issue, so that the depth buffer is properly recreated.
    * gl_fullbrights 0 and 2 modes has been removed owing to excessive video RAM usage.
    * Potential for vertex and index buffer sizes to overflow max allowed by your hardware has been removed.
