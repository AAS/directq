DirectQ 1.8.666
Release Candidate 1
==============

This is Release Candidate 1 of DirectQ 1.8.666; I am holding off on doing a full "stable" release as a LOT of code has
changed behind the scenes since 1.8.4, and there may be quite a few juicy bugs yet to come out.

This release is intended for anyone who is willing to be at the bleeding edge of technology, happy to take the risk that
the engine might crash, and agreeable to report such crashes to me (with enough info to enable me to reproduce them) at
http://mhquake.blogspot.com

Everyone else should just use 1.8.4 and wait a while longer for the "stable" build.

Thanks to Baker and =Peg= for beta-testing this, and everyone else who has made suggestions or provided feedback.

(Technical note: this release is a debug build, meaning that if it crashes, and if you have debugging tools on your
computer, you may be able to provide me with more information relating to the crash.)
