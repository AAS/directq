---------------------

- Fixed bug in cvar and cmd compatibility layer where the original cvar or cmd could sometimes be accidentally stomped.
- Fixed bug where crosshair colour wasn't working.


DIRECTQ 1.8.3 UPDATE
--------------------

- Added test and failure cases to web download code for several less likely scenarios.
- Added more robust OS versioning.
- Allowed a PS version that's downlevel from the VS version and enabled shader optimizations.
- Optimized surface bbox culling by only checking on surfs where both the leaf and the node intersect the frustum.
- Removed "hard-coding" of release version from the splash screen.
- Removed all static linking dependencies from DirectX DLLs.
- Added d3dx_version cvar to switch between different versions of the D3DX DLLs (default 42).
- Resolved massive speed drain from drawing the console and strings on some platforms.
- Tidied up interpolation somewhat and switched it to cubic interpolation.
- Removed fixed pipeline fog (shader model 3 compatibility).
- Added HLSL path for underwater warp and optimized by incorporating polyblend with the post-process.
- Improved timer to only wrap if DirectQ itself is running for > ~49 days.
- Reworked FPS counter more to my liking.
- Optimized vertex buffers a little better.
- Cleaned up render to texture interface a little.
- Disabled Windows key and accessibility shortcuts while DirectQ is running.
- Enabled better non-power-of-2 texture support.
- Generalised Draw_PicTranslate better and made it more robust.
- Tweaked lightmaps slightly for faster and smoother rendering.
- Optimized vertex buffer usage for most critical object types.
- Randomised base animation for skin and frame groups on alias models (consistency with software Quake).
- Implemented better quake.rc handling that works with custom quake.rc files provided by those wacky modders!
- Added cvar and command compatibility layer to prevent cvars and commands that I've removed from throwing a warning if invoked from QC.
