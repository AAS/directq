DIRECTQ 1.7.666c UPDATES
========================

* Increased quality of sound scale table (less abrupt transitions between volume levels).
* Increased sound paintbuffer size to help prevent sound stuttering, breakup or drop-out.
* Added ProQuake NAT fix (use cl_natfix to toggle, default 1 (on)).
* Fixed bug where BeginScene would not get called in time if only liquid surfs were visible in the world.
* Rationalized sound buffer locking and usage a little better.
* Fixed bug where a player head model skin would get replaced with a full player model skin.
* Begun generalising the effect system for both HLSL and non-HLSL.
* Added fallback for cases where L8, A8L8 and X8R8G8B8 texture formats are not supported.
* Added rudimentary HalfLife BSP Support (not too robust, yes I'm aware of the bugs).
* Added exception handling around main loop to try help with restoring gamma correctly after a crash.
* Added HLSL classic sky warp - no depth buffer trickery, no perspective trickery, just looks *right*.
