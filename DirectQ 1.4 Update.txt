Release 1.4 updates.
====================

Gratitude to everyone who provided bug reports and/or feedback on the last release.  Your contribution has definitely helped make this one better.

* Fixed r_novis 1 crash.
* Removed contents transition code from R_MarkLeaves - doesn't play nice with translucency and doesn't handle entities.
* Fixed lockups in OpenQuartz and other mods where inline bmodels seem to share surfaces.
* Renamed r_anisotropicfilter to gl_texture_anisotropy (consistency with other engines).
* Added FOV to video/view menu.
* Changed widescreen fix so that it's only effective at FOV 90 (consistency with other engines).
* Added fov_compatible cvar to allow player to override this.
* Removed HUD when loading plaque is visible (looks wrong).
* Fixed instanced brush model R_LightPoint start position.
* Added missing sprite types from WinQuake.
* Switched viewsize to 120 when loading plaque is up (still not sure, looks right at intermissions though).
* Increased Alias Model vertex limits.
* Fixed display of savegame date and time (mental note to self: ".sav.sav" is not a valid extension here...)
* Switched mapshots to 128*128 PNG format (TGAs unstable & old size was too large); reverted display to 128*128.
* Removed MAX_EDICTS print out from SV_SpawnServer (should have never made it to release).
* Fixed problem with rotating weapon models being clipped when they shouldn't.
* Removed limit on surface extents.
* Restored limit on surface extents (lightmap size of 128 * 128 enforces a max of 2032).
* Fixed lightmap corruption on Quark ETP maps (grrrrrrrrr).
* Fully removed old zone.cpp/zone.h code.
* Cleaned out remainder of old sbar code.
* Updated window title and splash screen to new version number.
* Fixed viewmodel with FOV > 90 and made compatible with zoom mode (i.e. retained classic behaviour with FOV < 90).
* Added 8 custom crosshairs (in addition to 2 standard - white '+' and orange '+').
* Fixed (I hope!!!) "reliving their dying throes" interpolation bug.
* Removed video modes where width is < height from the available modes list.
* Added FPS counter to HUD display (scr_showfps) - in HUD menu.
* Added Clock to HUD display (scr_clock) - in HUD menu.
* Removed anti-wallhack from server pending fix of blinky problems (use a different engine as a server...)
* Added "sound/cdtracks" as an alternative for MP3 source folder (grrrr Darkplaces grrrr).
* Switched mapshots back to TGA.
* Cleared out more legacy crap (currenttexture, cnttextures, skytexturenum, stuff like that).
* Added (hopefully) more robust translucent water detection.
* Switched Heap memory allocation from CRT to Windows API (different behavior between debug and release builds with CRT).


WHAT DIDN'T MAKE IT
-------------------
Addition of crosshairs to the menu.
In-game resolution changing (STILL!)
Fixing gl_flashblend 1 mode.
More info on OSD stuff (pings, time remaining, etc).

WHAT MIGHT BE STILL BROKEN
--------------------------
Water translucency (works so far but you never know till it goes to the wild...)
