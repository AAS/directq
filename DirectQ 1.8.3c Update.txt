DIRECTQ 1.8.3c UPDATE
---------------------

This update patches some late breaking bugs and adds some extra performance to alias model (MDL) drawing.

- Fixed bug where mouse cursor was visible when entering a map and not using DirectInput.
- Fixed bug where you would be pointing at the sky and wildly spinning when not using DirectInput.
- Fixed bug where key up events were not being sent for mouse buttons when not using DirectInput.
- Added vertex cache optimization for MDL files.
- Fixed lagged keyboard when DirectQ is not the active application.
- Fixed bug where MP3 music may occasionally loop after 1 or 2 seconds instead of playing the full track.
- Added capability to stream media container files from the internet.
- Fixed bug where a TGA texture may occasionally fail to load correctly (e.g. top skybox in 5 Rivers).
