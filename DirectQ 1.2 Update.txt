Release 1.2 updates.
====================

* Incorporated changes from 1.1 Emergency Releases.
* Fixed bug where a spawned backpack could sometimes inherit the angles of the dead player/monster.
* Added positional interpolation (r_lerporient, default 1).
* Added frame interpolation (r_lerpframe, default 1).
* Ported menu framework code.
* Moved Options menu to framework.
* Moved Main menu to framework.
* Changed clear colour to black now that I no longer need to check for clearing.
* Moved Single Player menu to framework.
* Fixed centerprints so that positioning is consistent.
* Fixed SCR_CenterPrint empty string bug.
* Moved Help menu to framework.
* Changed help menu so that it starts at page 1 if playing the registered version.
* Reworked Quit menu as a SCR_ModalMessage.
* Added last line of console output at bottom of screen for when menus are active (user feedback).
* Fixed occasional bug where Windows keeps a file open lock on config.cfg even after it's been closed.
* Fixed chase camera so it can never go inside (or through) a solid leaf.
* Adjusted number of save games to infinite; removed name restrictions.
* Moved save/load menus to framework.
* Fixed all remaining chasecam clipping/noclipping problems.
* Changed default m_boost value to 1.
* Changed appearance of SCR_ModalMessage messages slightly (added "Confirm" header and "[Y/N]" prompt).
* Fixed occasional DirectInput lockups/stalls.
* Removed "no multi-threaded" restrictions from Direct3D startup.
* Changed alias model bounding box cull and chasecam clip tests to per-frame bounding boxes.
* Removed old sky warp and r_oldsky cvar.
* Added Q2/etc style noclipping (was this in 1.1?)
* Changed speed and direction of new sky warp to more accurately mimic old sky warp.
* Removed surface subdivision from sky.
* Removed brush model specific stuff from model_t struct.
* Added struct header pointers for each model type to model_t struct.
* Massive cleanup, restructuring and explanations in submodel setup.
* Added fading of chase model when chasecam gets near it owing to geometry clipping.
* Added translucent viewmodel when one has the ring.
* Added translucent chase model when viewed from nearby.
* Switched mipmap chain generation to manual as automatic doesn't work too well on some cards.
* Restored HARDWARE_VERTEX_PROCESSING (need to test for lockups on NVIDIA).
* Changed default scr_conspeed to 3000 and scr_printspeed to 20 (from 300 and 8).
* Restored lightmap texture rectchange system (easier in D3D as top is 0 and it uses r and b, not w and h).
* Left lightmap textures locked for the entire map (to save locking/unlocking per frame).
* Removed glpoly_t from gl_model.h to gl_warp.cpp as that's the only place it's used any more.
* Gave water and sky their own custom vertex structs.
* Moved Multiplayer menu to framework.
* Commenced moving Setup menu to framework.
* Wrote a *real* textbox for "Hostname" and "Your Name".
* Removed display of Help page 0 ("Ordering") from the registered version.
* Fixed bug where the save menu would crash if there were no save games but was otherwise valid.
* Removed IPX Code.
* Restored r_wateralpha functionality (mimics stock GLQuake, no fancy changes).
* Cvar-ized light animation interpolation (r_lerplightstyle, default 1).
* Restored gl_flashblend 1 mode and made gl_flashbend an archive cvar (retained 0 as new default).
* Added r_lightupdatefrequency cvar to control how many times per second lightmaps update (default 0 = always).
* Added CDAudio_Stop to S_StopAllSounds.
* Added DirectShow code for media playback for when no CD is present.
* Added render to texture code for water warp updates.
* Removed surface subdivision from water surfaces.
* Replaced gl_warp_sin.h with internally generated sin table.
* Finished render to texture for water surfs (we lose a few frames here but the improvement is worth it).
* Expanded BSP light data to 3 component.
* Removed interpolation from muzzleflashes on viewmodels.
* Moved keybindings menu to framework.
* Fixed FPS loss with render to texture.
* Finished Multiplayer Setup Menu.
* Switched cvars to static storage of name and string (code simplification).
* Added more generally usable "Draw_TextBox" routine.
* Fixed bug in Save/Load menu where this->CurrentOption == NULL would crash on an unhandled key.
* Added sound/cdtracks as an optional music directory (first preference, fallback on music if not present).
* Allowed spaces or non-alphanumeric characters in save/load names.
* Added detection of invalid windows filename chars in save/load names.
* Added con_lineheight cvar to control height of console lines (default 8, same as classic Quake).
* Added external texture loader (not linked in to internal loader yet).
* Added mapshot drawing system.
* Added external BSP texture support: link, dds, tga, bmp, png and jpg formats supported.
* Adjusted default vid_gamma to 1.0 (consistency between external and native textures).
* Added scr_screenshotformat cvar (default tga), supports tga, bmp, png, jpg and dds.
* Finished mapshot writing.
* Cvar-ized screenshot directory (scr_screenshotdir, default "screenshot") - not as robust as it could be, don't try anything fancy!
* Cvar-ized external textures directory (gl_texturedir, default "textures") - see comment above.
* Cvar-ized save directory (host_savedir, default "save") - see comment above.
* Added hardware gamma control - uses old v_gamma cvar, works with -gamma cmdline (which is still retained).
* Moved TCP/IP - new game menu to framework.
* Fixed bug where the game would crash if a menu with no options at all was entered.
* Moved TCP/IP - join game menu to framework.
* Fixed bug where the game would crash on a key other than ESC in a menu with no options.
* Reverted alias models to whole model bbox cull tests (reliability).
* Moved game options menu to framework.
* Added deathmatch 0, coop 0 and teamplay 0 to load command.
* Added Input Options menu.
* Added Effects Options menu.
* Added Chase Camera Options menu.
* Added Content Directories menu.
* Made cvars self-registering and cmds self-adding.
* Added initial load of configs (setting cvars only) to get correct values in before anything else comes up.
* Increased several internal limits to match those of FitzQuake.
* Tested Marcher Fortress; ensured load and correct appearance.
* Fixed textbox startup when the length of the initial string was > 16.
* Fixed bug in textbox where holding down shift to type a capital letter would trigger the "deny" sound.
* Removed limit on number of static entities.
* Verified we can at least *load* cavetest2. ;D
* Removed software gamma calculations (WinQuake legacy).
* Added independent control of red/green/blue gamma (in addition to master control): r_gamma/g_gamma/b_gamma, defaults 1.
* Removed scr_copytop, scr_copyeverything, scr_fullupdate, sb_updates, Sbar_Changed (software legacy).
* Removed limit on number of particles; initial 4096, extra 2048 as required, cleared between maps.
* Fixed unsigned short to short translations in BSP loading.
* Fixed bug where a desktop resolution with 800 height would give a mode with 768 height as a valid windowed mode.
* Fixed bug where the vid_mode cvar was not being set correctly (at all, actually!) on startup.
* Fixed bug where dlights shine on backfacing surfs.
* Added smoother transitions between r_viewleafs with dfferent contents types.
* Moved "Search for Local Games" to framework.
* Added support for reading vid_mode from the configs and setting the correct mode according to that.
* Added r_lockpvs cvar for locking PVS to the current viewleaf; map development aid, default 0.
* Fixed bug where Alt-Tabbing back to a fullscreen mode would leave the screen garbled (viewport code needs a huge cleanup!)
* Finished porting of menus to framework.
* Fully removed gl_ztrick; it was *not* a happy bunny.
* Cleaned up the mess I had made of viewports.
* Fixed loss of LOD with warp update render to texture (more FPS loss as a result).
* Restored r_speeds 1 wpoly counter, left broken epoly counter (consistency with previous versions & other engines).
