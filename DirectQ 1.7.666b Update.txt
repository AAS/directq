DIRECTQ 1.7.666b UPDATES
========================

* Set minimum far clip to 4096 so that it plays nice with maps/mods that expect it.
* Fixed menu shortcut keys/commands not allowing you to exit from menus properly.
* Fixed vid_restart and state restore at fullscreen console.
* Cleaned up game changing a little.
* Restored mouse pointer is visible in menu and console screens with windowed mode.
* Forced r_wireframe to always off in multiplayer (potential wallhack).
* Reimplemented (optional, only if supported) pixel shader water warp.
* Added r_hlsl cvar to toggle hlsl on or off (for cards that don't run well with it) - default 1.
* Switched all fog to per-pixel when using pixel shaders (simplicity).
* Fixed issue with hud_sbaralpha saving as integer in HUD configs.
* Added "Change Game Directory" to Options menu in simple mode.
* Set skill 1 when selecting New Game from the SinglePlayer menu.
* Fixed autocomplete bug where an empty content list would crash the game.
* Modified player skin caching system to actually be reliable.
* Removed console and menu from display when a map is started in play/record/time demo mode.
* Added sv_speed cvar (default 1) to control the rate at which time passes - use values < 1 for slowmo.
* Restored variable water surf subdivision via gl_subdivide_size (and old ugliness with values > ~32).
  (This isn't used with r_hlsl 1).
* Switched mouse input from immediate to buffered and made it more robust vs "can't stop moving after release".
* Fixed CPU yielding when paused/minimized/not the focus/etc.
* Added r_gunangle cvar, default 2, set to 0 for FitzQuake/DarkPlaces style gun (1 is intermediate).
* Enabled key auto-repeat for console and menus.
* Reverted full scoreboard to old behaviour (releasing TAB hides it) in multiplayer games.
* Enforced old ammo/health box lighting method in multiplayer games.
* Reverted something similar to old alias model lighting range in multiplayer games.
